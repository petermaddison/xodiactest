What a year 2018 was! So much going on and so many great stories to tell.

Of course, most importanly we started Xodiac. 

From talking to friends and colleagues I had seen an opportunity to help organizations break down the barriers to accelerating delivery. Knowing I couldnâ€™t do this on my own I started looking around for like minded individuals who would be willing to join me on this adventure. After much conversation I found two such colleagues in Gino and Varinder and we founded Xodiac.

Iâ€™ve both been a member of and built high performing teams in my career. I'm very excited about what bringing Xodiac together can achieve. Each of us brings a different but overlapping skill set to the table and with a common goal, to help every team thrive, we have the potential to do great things. 

We had a fantastic start in 2018, refining our message and winning over clients and partners. Weâ€™ve formed great relationships and opened the door to many opportunities, helping both our clients and partners succeed and grow. Weâ€™ve been so busy that we also started hiring and brought Tona onboard in October to help accelerate that growth even further.

On top of all that, I personally started working towards my professional coaching certification with the ICF but that is a topic for another blog post ðŸ˜Š

Happy holidays everybody!

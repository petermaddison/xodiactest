Beyond providing advice in order to help teams thrive, we need to help teams move along in their journey. The better we can do this the more impact we can truly have. 

When the rubber hits the road, how do we execute?

As a continuous learner, I am always looking for interesting topics to study. In 2018, I wound up at a cottage talking with a friend, and he introduced me to the idea of coaching as a separate discipline. By which I mean, separate from counseling, consulting, mentoring, teaching and, indeed, other roles labeled as coaches in business such as Agile coach or DevOps coach.

Intrigued I started digging into the topic and discovered there is a rich history around coaching tied to neuroscience and psychology. This felt like a valuable extension to my technical skills and a useful body of knowledge. 

I am now well on my way to becoming a certified ICF coach and have already found the skills and tools valuable in many aspects of the work we do. 

One of the goals of taking this course is to solve the question of when I'm consulting and when I'm coaching. Being able to switch between the different modes of interaction is valuable and allows for bringing great meaning to the transformational work we do.

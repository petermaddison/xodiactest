2018 was a very important and pivotal year for me. I had a dream and I was looking for a right plan and time to execute. I was working on a couple of different ideas when Peter and Gino discussed the idea of Xodiac. It all made sense and in May 2018, we (Peter, Gino and I) founded Xodiac with a mission “making every team thrive”. 

What is the most important ingredient required for a team to thrive or prosper?  We believe it is “the right culture and environment”. An environment of constant feedback, learning, and transparency will help teams thrive. We are living this mission statement in Xodiac. As we are growing our business and team, we are constantly learning and refining ourselves as a team and as an organization.

With a successful 2018, short but a mighty year under our belt, we are geared up for 2019. We are looking forward to expand our partner ecosystem to build a strong offering for our clients.

I am particularly excited about our capability around Data Management maturity. Data is one of the most valuable resources within an organization. Each organization is at a different level of maturity when it comes to Data Management. Xodiac will be able to help organizations assess their maturity levels and create a plan for data teams to thrive. 

In the end, we wish all our clients, partners and community a fruitful and prosperous 2019.

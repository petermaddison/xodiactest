			<h1>What's in a name?</h1>
			
			<p>
				Our mission is to <i>make every team thrive</i>, to unleash their full potential. Regardless of their size or
				objectives, we take teams on a journey to find their best self, kind of like a treasure hunt for the team's
				treasure, where <span class="title-font">X</span> marks the spot. The teams we work with use Xodiac as a
				vessel that takes them from where they are to where they aspire to be, just like a zodiac - a type of
				inflatable boat - connects ship passengers with an otherwise unreachable shore.
			</p>

			<h2>And a logo?</h2>
			
			<p>
				The Xodiac logo is made up of four arrows directed at the same focal point. This symbolizes teams that
				achieve much larger and more meaningful results than any individual team member ever could. Combined they
				resemble a green thriving flower, with the arrows as petals, indicative of a healthy, thriving team.
			</p>
			<p>
				From the space in between the arrows emerges a plus sign, referring to the combined strengths of the
				team members exceeding the sum of the individual strengths. And of course the logo as a whole represents the
				letter <span class="title-font">X</span>.

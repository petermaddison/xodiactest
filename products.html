				<h1>Socrates helps your team get better</h1>
				<p>
					Is your team not in a position to hire a dedicated agile coach? Socrates can help your team to ask the right questions and get better as a result.

				<h2>10 minutes every day</h2>

					Socrates challenges your team on a daily basis to discuss a statement related to their delivery capability.
					With a time investment of only 10 minutes per day, your team will become more intentional about their delivery
					process and will develop a mindset of continuous improvement. Socrates will guide your team in critical
					thinking and increase the willingness to challenge the status quo, both building blocks for any successful coaching engagement.
